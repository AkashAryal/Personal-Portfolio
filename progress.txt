posts now appear on home page fine. Next steps are to add the crud functions (update post, delete post etc...)<DELETE DONE>. CSS. Also set up post page for each post based on id. <a> tag with link to controller sending id should be good. Also make image, title clickable and direct user to post page.
set up edit. currently trying to find out how get route thing to work in edit.blade.php
